    <!-- This project represents a data self-portrait, combining images and data visualization to present an artistic and detailed representation of my music career. I thought it would be cool to show both the analytical side of the music as well as the realism of performing to display both sides of the coin when it comes to this profession. The design choices include a flexible layout using CSS Flexbox, interactive hover effects, and visually appealing rounded corners and shadows. Each image is contained within a styled div to enhance presentation and user experience. -->

        <p>It's hard to say whether Kwajo is a talented rapper with a great voice, or a natural born singer with the gift of bars. Influenced by the likes of Amin√© and Saba, Kwajo blends introspective lyricism with captivating melodies. His musical background is rooted in the sounds of Paramore and 5 Seconds of Summer, which have helped shape his alternative musical style. Kwajo's goal as an artist is to spread God's word and his message of kindness and love, while being transparent about his own story and serving as a source of inspiration for those who resonate with his music.</p>
